Tibor Auer,Dr,He/him,Research Fellow,"School of Psychology, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom","I received my undergraduate degree in medicine (MD) and my PhD in clinical neuroscience from the University of Pécs, Hungary, where I implemented various neuroimaging techniques in a clinical environment. My first post-doc project at the Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH in Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen focused on real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback with special emphasis on the implementation and the optimization of the experimental setup and the analysis. My main current project is on optimising neuromodulation approaches, such as tACS based on real-time neural signals, and I also collaborate in other real-time fMRI and neurofeedback projects. I also work on how to improve the temporal resolution and reliability of fMRI-based neurofeedback, and co-develop OpenNFT, a Python/Matlab framework for real-time fMRI neurofeedback and automatic analysis, a Matlab framework to process multimodal neuroimaging analysis pipelines. I am also a strong supporter of transparency and replicability of neuroimaging approaches, and I am involved in international initiatives such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure and Neuroimaging Data Model providing a standard of organising neuroimaging data.""",https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/tibor-auer,TiborAuer,tiborauer

Irene Dupong,Ms,She/her,Physician,University of Paris,I’m a child psychiatrist beginning a PhD in November 2020 on brain imaging and autism. I’m interested in how the brain makes abstractions.,,IreneDupong,
Cooper Smout,Dr,He/Him,Researcher,Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education,"My PhD focused on the neural mechanisms of attention and prediction in visual awareness, using computational modelling and multivariate analyses of human brain imaging data (EEG and MEG) to investigate how predictions bias attention and visual awareness. I'm also passionate about using the principles of Open Science to create a fair and efficient system of scholarly communication. To help achieve this, I founded Project Free Our Knowledge.",https://www.freeourknowledge.org,coopsmout,FreeOurKnowledge
