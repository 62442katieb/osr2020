My first post-doc project at the Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH in Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen focused on real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback with special emphasis on the implementation and the optimization of the experimental setup and the analysis. My main current project is on optimising neuromodulation approaches, such as tACS based on real-time neural signals, and I also collaborate in other real-time fMRI and neurofeedback projects. I also work on how to improve the temporal resolution and reliability of fMRI-based neurofeedback, and co-develop OpenNFT, a Python/Matlab framework for real-time fMRI neurofeedback and automatic analysis, a Matlab framework to process multimodal neuroimaging analysis pipelines. I am also a strong supporter of transparency and replicability of neuroimaging approaches, and I am involved in international initiatives such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure and Neuroimaging Data Model providing a standard of organising neuroimaging data.""",https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/tibor-auer,TiborAuer,tiborauer
