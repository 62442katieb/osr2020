In this fourth and last post of the series, I share a number of useful resources for learning more about SPM12 and Matlab scripting.

### SPM12 GUI use and processing steps

- The SPM12 user manual has a number of useful step-by-step tutorials explaining the use of the GUI. I recommend starting there for beginners (with the auditory task, a.k.a. “Mother of all Experiments”, being a first step).
- Justin O’Brien has a [series of Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml_YmvZ1t_M&list=PLxItDNjOWyDVMOerTs-ZRwtQQSE76ULm5) on SPM12 GUI use.
- Erno Hermans has a great [SPM12 Starters Guide](http://www.ernohermans.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spm12_startersguide.pdf) that explains the GUI steps in a more relatable way (in my experience, at least).


### SPM12 and Matlab programming/scripting

- The [SPM Wiki page](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM), apart from providing useful info and links to other related resources, also links to an [SPM Programming Intro](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Programming_intro) and further useful [How-To’s](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/How-to).
- The Nibabel site has some [SPM use cases](https://nipy.org/nibabel/devel/spm_use.html).
- Anything by Matthew Brett is great (as are most resources on the [MRC CBU Wiki](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/CbuImaging)), including his:
  - [Introduction to SPM statistics](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/PrinciplesStatistics)
  - [An introduction to smoothing](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/PrinciplesSmoothing)
  - [Diagnostics for fMRI](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DataDiagnostics)
  - [Slice display](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DisplaySlices)
- [Akira O’Connor](http://akiraoconnor.org/category/spm/) has a number of very useful blog posts
- [Andy’s Brain Blog](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/) (with older posts [here](http://andysbrainblog.blogspot.com/)) has very useful posts and Youtube videos on many aspects of SPM12. It also includes useful tutorials using other image processing tools like FSL and AFNI.
- [Tom Nichols’s blog](https://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/nichols/tag/spm99/) also has great scripts and discussions.
- [Cyril Pernet’s github](https://github.com/CPernet) with many useful scripts
- [Bob Spunt’s github](https://github.com/spunt) with many useful scripts
