### What is the OSR?
The Open Science Room (OSR) is a conference within a conference,
at the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/">Organisation for Human Brain Mapping</a>
annual meeting in <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3958&activateFull=true" >Montreal June 26th - 30th</a>.
As with the rest of the meeting we are here to discuss advances in neuroimaging, but we also have a specific interest in open research practices.

### Who can present in the OSR?
Anyone can present in the OSR!
We invite presentations linked to our [themes](themes.md)
and in the specified [formats](formats.md),
but we also have room for unconferece style "emergent" sessions where you can discuss anything you would like!
We would like to especially platform the work of Early Career Researchers (ECRs),
and provide the lightning talk format for you to give voice to posters which have been accepted in the main meeting.

**The call for presentations will open on March 16th and close on April 10th.
Emergent sessions may be added after that time.
Please submit your proposal for a presentation via the [submit](submit.md) page.**


### Who can visit the OSR?
Anyone can visit the OSR!
Our content is scheduled to avoid clashes with keynotes,
award presentations and community discussions in the main meeting,
so we hope many of you will make the choice to visit us among the parallel sessions!
We have also intentionally minimised our scheduling during the poster sessions,
so our ECR community do not have to choose between presenting their posters or presenting in the OSR!

### Do I have to attend the conference to participate in OSR?
Short answer - No!
This year we will be live streaming OSR content onto the [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ),
where you will be able to ask questions and interact with our speakers.
We are also aware that travel restrictions or environmental choices may limit who can attend the meeting in person,
so we invite submissions for remote presentation in these circumstances.
Further detail on this is available on our [accessibility](access.md) page,
and will be released in due course.

*If your proposal is accepted for an in-person presentation in the OSR,
you will need to be <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3969">registered</a>
for the main conference which hosts us.
We are unfortunately unable to provide honoraria or financial assistance to presenters in the OSR.*


### When will I know if I have been accepted to present in the OSR?
We intend to finalise our main content by April 15th so it can be included in the main conference program.
We will let you know by this date if you have been accepted to present in one of the scheduled OSR session.
You can also request to present an "emergent" session up to and during the meeting itself, if space allows.

*Please note the conference <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3969">
reduced early bird resignation rate </a> is available until April 1st.
If your ability to attend the conference will be influenced by being accepted for a talk in the OSR and
registering at the early bird rate, please submit your presentation proposal by March 30th and separately
[contact us](contact.md) (including a link to your proposal issue on our GitHub repository) to discuss whether
we can accommodate an earlier decision.*


### Who will decide if my presentation proposal is accepted in the OSR?
All submitted proposals will automatically populate an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/osr2020">GitHub repository</a>.
The community is then invited to openly review and comment on proposals,
and we will use this feedback to inform our decisions in selecting presentations
should we reach capacity. The final decisions on content will be determined through a
combination of relatedness to our themes, community interest, and diversity of representation.
We will also prioritise accepted poster presentations for lightning talks.
Final decisions will be overseen by the <a href="https://ossig.netlify.com/">elected OS-SIG officials</a>.


### What if my presentation clashes with my talk/poster in the main meeting?!
We are in communication with the main conference Program Committee and will do our best
to avoid clashes for particular speakers. Please let us know at the earliest opportunity
if you will be unable to present in your allocated slot, and we will do our best to move things around to accommodate you.


### How do I contact the OSR?
Before the meeting you can contact using one of the channels described [here](contact.md).

During the meeting you will be able to identify members of the OSR team via our
branded t-shirts(!) which we'll wear during the meeting and while in the OSR.
You are very welcome to approach us at any time to ask questions about the OSR or open research in general!
