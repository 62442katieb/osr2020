<div id='what'></div>
### What is the OSR?
The Open Science Room (OSR) is a conference within a conference, at the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/">Organisation for Human Brain Mapping</a> (OHBM) annual meeting. The meeting this year will be held on a virtual platform, opening on June 23rd. The OSR hosts discussions around advances in neuroimaging, but we have a specific interest in open research practices.

<div id='whopresent'></div>
### Who will be presenting in the OSR?
We have selected presentation following an open call for submission and an open review. The [schedule](schedule.html) of talks contains links to the accepted presentations, with links to speaker bios. You can also review [speaker profiles](speakers-PLACEHOLDER.md).

We are open to [submissions for emergent](submit.md) discussion throughout the meeting. Emergent organisers will also be listed on the [speakers](speamers-PLACEHOLDER.md) page where profiles are provided.

<div id='whovisit'></div>
### Who can participate in the OSR?
Anyone can participate in the OSR! Our content is scheduled to minimise clashes with live material being presented in the main meeting, and there will be repeat broadcasts at different [timezones](access.md/#hubs) so you can join at a time convenient for you.

You must register for the OSR to obtain the relevant details to join the discussions. Registration for the OSR is bundled into the main meeting if you are attending the full <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3958">OHMB program</a>. Details for how to join the OSR will be provided in the OHBM Meeting Virtual Platform.

You can also [register](register-PLACEHOLDER.md) for the OSR at [zero-cost](access.md/#zero-cost). Please complete the registration form and we will communicate details on howbto join the conversation before the meeting commences on June 23rd.

<div id='attend'></div>
### Do I have to travel to participate in the OSR?
Short answer - No! This year we will be virtual only, and you can attend from anywhere with an internet connection and access to a web browser.

<div id='when'></div>
### When will I know if I have been accepted to present in the OSR?
We have communicated with all lightning, demo and keynote submission authors to confirm outcome.

If you have submitted a proposal for an emergent session, there will be a brief review process to determine whether your proposal is broadly relevant to our community. We will aim to get back to you on the same day to confirm your proposal has been accepted and communicate the process for booking time to host your session in our program.

<div id='clash'></div>
### What if my presentation clashes with my talk/poster in the main meeting?!
We have attempted to minimise clashes between our own content and that of the main meeting. Unfortunately it is unlikely that we will be able to adjust the schedule if there is a clash between your scheduled appearance in the OSR and activities in the main meeting. In these situations we ask that you contact us as soon as possible and we will work with you to find a convenient time to address the Q&A portion of your talk. If you are hosting an emergent session, you will be given access to our calendar to book a convenient time to hold your session.

<div id='contact'></div>
### How do I contact the OSR?
Before and during the meeting you can contact using one of the channels described [here](contact.md).

During the meeting you will be able to identify members of the OSR team at named locations in the virtual environment. We are working towards supporting both text and one-to-one video chat between attendees and the OSR team. We will provide more details on this as they emerge!

<div id='virtual'></div>
### How will the virtual OSR differ from the in-person OSR?
We'd like for it to be as similar as possible! We have created a space for talks, spaces for chat and networking, the ability to ask questions from speakers, and a chance for one-to-one or one-to-many support from the community, to ask your questions about working open.

There have been a few format changes from the main meeting to reduce the load (no-one is going to attend 8 hours of online talks!) and compensate for the understanding that attention spans will be divided when attending online, working with an approximately 50% shorter attention span. The scheduled talks will be a maximum of 30 minutes long, and there will be comfortable breaks throughout the day. We will also make greater use of polls and audience interaction tools to keep you engaged and there will be live chat happening alongside talks. There will also be "on-demand" material which you can watch whenever it is convenient for you.

<div id='time-zones'></div>
### How will you handle time zone differences of attendees?
We have structured our content to be repeated across three [timezone hubs](accedd.md/#hubs) over 24 hours. The "official program" of accepted talks will run for 2 hours 30 minutes per day, and we have timed it to fit into a 09:00 - 17:00 day for most regions within each hub. Emergent and social sessions will be held at the beginning and end of each day, so they should be convenient for the start or end of the day in each hub depending on where you are located. Take a look at our [schedule](schedule.html) to find time of broadcast in your hub, and view activities in your local time zone.

<div id='prerecord'></div>
### Why have talks been pre-recorded?
Pre-recording of talks will minimise technicalities in switching between speakers, which will be frequent in the short formats. Giving a prerecorded talk also means the speaker can be on hand to answer questions from the community during the talk itself, and will not have to split their attention between presentation and text chat. Pre-recording also means presenters will have a greater opportunity to deliver the talk they were aiming for in the allotted time, which will be invaluable for these short format sessions. Pre-recording also means that we have all material ready to broadcast across each hub following the arch of the day, rather than waiting for speakers to wake up in their local timezones before we can share their work with the world!

<div id='contributors'></div>
### Who has contributed to the OSR?
the OSR has been built by the [OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OS-SIG)](https://ossig.netlify.app/), and the generous support of our team of  [volunteers](volunteers.md) who responded to our call for contributors. We are indebted to the them for the time and energy they have brought to this project.

You can join the team for next year by running for election into the OS-SIG, or staying close to OS-SIG activities and reaching out as we start to build again next year! You can find out more about our operations by joining our content on [Friday June 26th](schedule.html), where we will host discussions around elections and an open Town Hall session where you can ask us anything!

<div id='sponsors'></div>
### Who has sponsored the OSR?
The OSR has been made possible this year by the generous support of [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform](https://conp-pcno.github.io/), [Courtois NeuroMod](https://www.cneuromod.ca/), [the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)](https://www.incf.org/), [OHBM Australian Chapter](https://ohbmaustralia.wordpress.com),[OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/) and [The Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroscience](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/). Thank you to all our sponsors, sponsors for helping us work towards our vision for an inclusive, world class OSR.
