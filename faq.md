## What is the OSR?
The Open Science Room (OSR) is a conference within a conference, at the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping annual meeting in Montreal, June 26th - 30th. As with the rest of the meeting we are here to discuss advances in neuroimaging, but we also have a specific interest in open research practices.

## Who can present in the OSR?
Anyone can present in the OSR! We invite presentations linked to our [themes](themes.md) and in the specified [formats](formats.md), but we also have room for unconferece-style "emergent" sessions where you can discuss anything you would like! We would like to especially platform the work of Early Career Researchers, and provide the lighting talk format for you to give voice to posters which have been accepted in the main meeting.

**The call for presentations will open on March 10th and close on April 10th. Emergent sessions may be added after that time.**


## Who can visit the OSR?
Anyone can visit the OSR! Our content is scheduled to avoid clashes with keynotes, award presentation and community discussions in the main meeting, so we hope many of you will make the choice to visit us among the parallel sessions! We have also intentionally minimised our scheduling during the poster sessions, so our ECR community do not have to choose between presenting in the posters or presenting in the OSR!

## Do I have to attend the conference to participate in OSR?
Short answer - No! This year we will be live streaming OSR content onto the [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ), where you will be able to ask questions and interact with our speakers. We are also aware that travel restrictions may limit who can attend the meeting in person, so we invite submissions for remote presentation in these circumstances. Further detail on these aspects is available on our [accessibility](accessibility.md) page, and will be released in due course.


## When will I know if I have been accepted to present in the OSR?
We intend to finalise our main content by April 15th so it can be included in the main conference program. We will let you know by this date if you have been accepted to present in one of the scheduled OSR session. You can also request to present an "emergent" session up to and during the meeting itself, if space allows.


## What if my presentation clashes with my talk/poster in the main meeting?!
We are in communication with the main conference Program Committee and will do our best to avoid clashes for particular speakers. Please let us know at the earliest opportunity if you will be unable to present in your allocated slot, and we will do our best to move things around to accomodate you.
