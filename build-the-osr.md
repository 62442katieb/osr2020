# Build Your OSR

The OSR is built by the community for the community. The OS-SIG have been working in the background to make this the biggest and best OSR yet, and we would love for you to contribute to the success of this community event as much or as little as you would like!

You are very welcome to join us at any point in the conference. But if you would like to be a little more hands on, your very welcome to help build the OSR you would like to see! This is an excellent opportunity to gain some valuable experience in working as an integral part of a conference organising team, and an excellent opportunity to shape the conference experience of those around you.

You don't need to have specific experience in open science, or even brain imaging! All we ask is that you are interested in providing a kind, welcoming, inclusive and inspiring experience for your fellow OSR attendees, and you're able to join the OSR organising committee in fortnightly online meetings.

We love to have support from people onsite at the meeting itself (a great way to make friends if you're already coming to Montreal!), but there is also work to be done before the meeting which doesn't require travel.

Below is a general description of the types of work we'd love for the community to engage with us on. If you'd like to share your skills in building these activities, or like to be involved in any other way, please fill in the form below to get in touch. We're very happy to have a chat about what we'll be working on before you commit to anything, so please don't be shy!
