Research is only reproducible if it is available to and accessible by all. We are taking a number of steps in the OSR to increase representation of marginalised folks and improve the experience of individuals with specific access needs. Everyone is invited to join us in the OSR, and we would like everyone to feel able to contribute.

## Live broadcast

For the first time in OHBM and OSR history, we will be broadcasting all the scheduled OSR material live via the [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ) to anyone who would like to tune in! We have championed this facility to support our colleagues who cannot or chose not to travel to Montreal in engaging with the OSR. The live broadcast will be supported with a system for receiving questions from distant viewers, to you can contribute directly to the discussion. We will support you with materials and advice if you would like to host a local "watch party" at your institution, and we look forward to bringing the OSR to your screens!

We are also pleased that the stream to YouTube will not require our viewers to install any additional software and the feed can be scaled to fit available bandwidth. We are aware that YouTube is currently not available in all countries and are working to identify a more universal solution. We are very happy to discuss options with you if YouTube is not a viable option for your region.

## Remote presentations

We understand that travelling to Montreal is not an option for many, and others are choosing to reduce their air travel in order to minimise their impact on our climate. We are therefore happy to support applications for remote presentation in the OSR. This may not be possible for all formats of presentation, but we are happy to consider and discuss technicalities with you.

## Sensory needs

We understand that the conference environment can be difficult to navigate for individuals with specific sensory needs.

For individuals requiring hearing or language support, all auditory content (both speakers and questions) will be amplified with microphones. We are also working towards providing live captions for scheduled presentations.

For individuals with visual impediments, we will provide presenters with suggestions for minimum font sizes and dyslexia friendly colours.

For individuals who would benefit from the use of quiet space, we are hoping to designate part of the OSR for quiet working or relaxation. We are working with the central OHBM team to make this a feature of the annual meeting going forwards.

## Have we missed anything?

If you have specific access needs which we haven't addressed in the above, we would love for you to let us know. Please feel free to point us to an example of good practice for your needs (or an advocacy group) and we will do our best to incorporate their advice.
