# Apply for a talks

We are holding an open call for talks in the OSR. Talks will broadly be arranged into three themes, but there will also be space to present on any topic you feel is appropriate to share with our community.

Theme specific talks will either be held in "[lightning](#lightning)", "[keynote](#keynote)" or "[demo](#demo)" sessions. Spontaneous or non-themed sessions are bookable in advance or during the meeting as "[emergent](#emergent)" sessions.

## Themes for the OSR 2020

The OSR has always been a place to learn and share experiences. This year we would like to structure these experiences around some areas which are undergoing rapid change in our discipline, while reflecting on where we have come from and what we may be heading towards!

### Theme 1: Open Workflows

Progressing from an idea to a reproducible research output as effectively as possible

The research outputs that we produce should be considered as educational materials. We are trying to share knowledge. How can we do this better?

### Theme 2: Open Data 2.0

Borrowing from the language of web, Open Data 2.0 represents a transition from static information dump (what might be classed as Open Data 1.0) to a social tool which facilitates collaboration. Do we have the resources available to support this transition? How are varied forms of collaboration serving our community to elevate and expedite high quality and justice oriented research? Perhaps we should be looking further into the future and ensure we are prepared for Open Data 3.0, where high quality meta-data will enable machine readable semantic understanding of the data to locate and compile sources?

Talks in these sessions will be looking to demonstrate advances in the field of open data, collaboration and data curation. We would like to celebrate what you have achieved and be inspired to bring new considerations to our own research practices.  

### Theme 3: The Past, Present and Future of Open Neuroimaging

How has openness in neuroscience and neuroimaging evolved over time, what have we learned from the past, and how are current activities shaping the future of open neuroimaging?

The idea is to make it a sort of retrospective: what did we think previously which we don't anymore, what lessons did we learn along the way; how do we approach things differently. All of this on topics related to open science. E.g. "we donâ€™t share data that way anymore since it lead to something something". Or, "we thought all along that open source projects with this structure would flourish, but actually this was the way it worked out".
