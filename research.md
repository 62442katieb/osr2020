My current Phd research focuses on two loosely defined topics within the broad field of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis:

1. Developing new signal processing methods the improve the quality of real-time functional MRI signals, for use in clinical applications like neurofeedback
2. Developing software tools and processes that assist fMRI researchers in implementing best practices for data quality control and methods reporting

My scientific interest stretches beyond these topics and somewhat more broadly into how we can improve transparency and reproducibility in science. I'm particularly interested in developing and sharing tools and methods that make our jobs as researchers easier, while simultaneously improving the scientific record or the way in which it can be queried, summarised and reused. This includes tools and processes for code sharing, data sharing, reproducible analysis environments, 

Whenever possible, I try to embed the concepts of collaboration, team science, community-centered project work, and openness into my work. 

I have generated some scientific output related to my research interests. Below, I'll try to list most of the relevant ones with links for you to access related content. These outputs often relate to specific [projects](projects.md) or [software](software.md) tools, for which ÃŒ provide more information on the respective site pages.
