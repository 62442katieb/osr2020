All presentation proposals will undergo open community review.

You are invited to provide feedback and indicate your interest in submitted proposals by commenting on individual proposal "issues" on our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/osr2020/issues">GitHub repository</a>. You are reminded that you will be expected to communicate on these proposals in accordance with the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3846">Code of Conduct</a>.

In order to comment on or endorse a proposal, you will be required to log into GitHub. If you do not have a GitHub username, we invite you to follow the instructions available <a href="https://github.com/">here</a> to create your free account.

The final selection of presentations will be determined through a combination of community interest, relatedness to our [themes](themes.md), and diversity of representation. We will also prioritise accepted poster presentations for lightening talks. All decisions will be overseen by the <a href="https://ossig.netlify.com/">elected OS-SIG officials</a>.
