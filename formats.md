We invite you to present you work in the OSR in one of the following formats. Theme specific talks will be presented in "[lightning](#lightning)", "[keynote](#keynote)" or "[demo](#demo)" sessions. Spontaneous or non-themed sessions are bookable in advance or during the meeting as "[emergent](#emergent)" sessions.

In all formats we would like to take this opportunity to intentionally diversify the range of speakers we hear from, and where possible platform voices which are traditionally under-represented in our field.

## Keynote

Keynote talks will be 30 minutes long, with 15 minutes for questions. These talks should showcase the best of our discipline with a clear message and call to action for our community.


## Lightning

Lighting talks will be 5 minutes long with 2 minutes for questions. In this session we will prioritise material which has been accepted as a poster in the main meeting, but invite submissions which are will also be presented in other formats in the main meeting or not presented elsewhere.

## Demo

Software demo sessions are a chance to showcase the latest developments in open source software, whether you developed it or would just like to champion it.

## Emergent

Emergent sessions are 15 minutes long, and framed as are conversations which you would like to have in an open format among your peers. You may use this opportunity to invite contributions to your collaborative project, or hold an open forum to discuss a development on social media or follow up on a discussion started in the main meeting. You are equally welcome to present other material which does not fit into one of the themes described above. You are welcome to book an emergent session now, or wait until you are at the meeting itself.
