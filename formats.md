We invite you to present your work in the OSR in one of the following formats. [Theme](theme.md) specific talks will be presented in "[keynote](#keynote)", "[lightning](#lightning)" or "[demo](#demo)" formats. Spontaneous or non-themed sessions are bookable in advance or during the meeting in an "[emergent](#emergent)" format.

In all formats we would like to take this opportunity to intentionally diversify the range of speakers we hear from, and where possible platform voices which are traditionally under-represented in our field.

Keynote talks will be 30 minutes long, with 15 minutes for questions. These talks should showcase the best of our discipline with a clear message and call to action for our community.


## Lightning

Lightning talks will be 5 minutes long with 2 minutes for questions. In these sessions we will prioritise presentations which have been accepted as a poster in the main meeting, but also invite submissions which will be presented in other formats or not presented elsewhere. Although these talks are short, they are an excellent opportunity to showcase your work to a dedicated audience!

## Demo

Software demo sessions are 7 minutes with 2 minutes for questions. These are a chance to showcase the latest developments in open source software, whether you have written the code yourself or would just like to champion the tool!

## Emergent

Emergent sessions are 15 minutes long. They can be framed as conversations which you would like to have in an open format among your peers.

You may use these sessions to invite contributions to your collaborative project, hold an open forum to discuss a development on social media, follow up on a discussion started in the main meeting, or basically anything you would like! You are equally welcome to share other research findings or practices which do not fit into one of the [themes](themes.md) we are promoting. You are welcome to book an emergent session via the [submit](submit.md) page now, or wait until you are at the meeting itself.
