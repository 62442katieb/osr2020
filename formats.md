We invite you to present your work in the OSR in one of the following formats.
[Theme](themes.md) specific talks will be presented in "keynote", "lightning", "demo" or "panel discussion" sessions.
Spontaneous or non-themed sessions are bookable in advance or during the meeting in an "Emergent" format.

In all formats we would like to take this opportunity to intentionally diversify the range of speakers we hear from,
and where possible platform voices which are traditionally under-represented in our field.

## Prerecorded and live talks

To smooth the flow of a virtual conference, we would like to prerecord Lightning and Demo talks. Recording can be done via a tool of your choosing, and we will provide tips and recommendations to maximise the impact of your talk. We are aiming for your recording to include contain both an image of yourself and your slides. We are finalising details of this process and will share more information or requirements with yuo as soon as they are available.

Keynote talks will be 30 minutes long, with 15 minutes for questions and discussion.
These talks should showcase the best of our discipline with a clear message and call to action for our community.

Keynotes may be followed by a panel discussion if appropriate for the talk. If you would like to be part of a panel following your keynote, we invite you to suggest names of up to three additional people who would promote discussion around the wider context of your talk. It would be preferable if panel members are at the meeting in person. You may wish to discuss you proposal with panel members before submission, but we do not expect you to have firm arrangements in place.


## Lightning <img align="left" src="../img/nounproj-lightning.png" alt="lightning" width="4%" hspace="20">

<!-- <img align="left" src="../img/nounproj-lightning.png" alt="lightning" width="10%" hspace="20"> -->

Lightning talks will be 5 minutes long with 2 minutes for questions.
In these sessions we will prioritise talks which have been accepted as a poster in the main meeting,
but also invite submissions which will be presented in other formats or not presented elsewhere.
Although these talks are short, they are an excellent opportunity to showcase your work to a dedicated audience!

## Demo <img align="left" src="../img/nounproj-demo.png" alt="demo" width="5%" hspace="20">

<!-- <img align="right" src="../img/nounproj-demo.png" alt="demo" width="12.5%" hspace="20"> -->

Software demo sessions are 7 minutes with 2 minutes for questions.
These are a chance to showcase the latest developments in open source software,
whether you have written the code yourself or would just like to champion the tool!

## Emergent <img align="left" src="../img/nounproj-Emergent.png" alt="Emergent" width="7%" hspace="15">

<!-- <img align="right" src="../img/nounproj-Emergent.png" alt="Emergent" width="15%" hspace="20"> -->

Emergent sessions may be variable length from 15 minutes to one hour. They can be framed as conversations which you would like to have in an open format among your peers.

You may use these sessions to invite contributions to your collaborative project, hold an open forum to discuss a development on social media, follow up on a discussion started in the main meeting, hold a panel discussion, or basically anything you would like! You are equally welcome to share other research findings or practices which do not fit into one of the [themes](themes.md) we are promoting. You are welcome to book an Emergent session via the [submit](submit.md) page now, or wait until you are at the meeting itself.
