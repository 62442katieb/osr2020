          <p>The <a href="https://ossig.netlify.com/">OS-SIG</a> Open Science Room (OSR) is part of at the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/">Organisation for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM)</a> annual meeting.</p>

          <p>This year the OSR will be open for <b>virtual attendance only!</b>. Decisions are still being made regarding hosting platforms and options for participation. We will be sure to post all relevant updates here and via our <a href = https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/contact/>communcation channels</a> as soon as we have them. In the mean time, please feel free to <a href = https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/contact/>contact us</a> if you have a specific question! </p>
           <!-- <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3958&activateFull=true" >Montreal June 26th - 30th.</a></p> -->

          <h3>What is the OSR?</h3>

          <p>The OSR is the place for meeting attendees to discuss open practices within neuroimaging and science more generally. The OSR is a welcoming environment which showcases the best of open science and acts as a springboard to incite new ways of thinking and working. Joining in with the activities of the OSR is a key opportunity to connect with others in the open neuroimaging community, learn from each other and share experiences. </p>

          <h3>What happens in the OSR?</h3>

          <p>The OSR hosts short talks, longer 'keynote' talks, software demonstrations, and emergent discussions, all centred around <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/themes/">themes</a> relevant to open science practices in our discipline. All scheduled talks will be selected following an <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/submit/">open call</a>. Emergent sessions can be booked now via the <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/submit/">submit</a> page or during the meeting itself (further details on this to follow).</p>

          <p> Talks, discussions and demonstrations in the OSR will be fresh, relevant and challenging. We aim to address new and emerging topics, fields and concerns, along with big picture issues in open science.</p>

          <p>The OSR is also a space to meet, hang out, work and collaborate! We are aiming to create virtual group working and interaction spaces, to support you in making real connections with other virtual attendees. You are very welcome to stop by when you have a free moment to explore and play in the space!</p>

          <h3>Who should come to the OSR?</h3>

          <p>The OSR is a space for <b>everyone</b>. We come with diverse skill sets, experiences and viewpoints, and we can all learn something new! We expect visitors to the OSR to comply with the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3846">Code of Conduct</a> for the OHBM annual meeting which hosts us. These behaviours are aligned with open science practices of sharing, collaboration, and inclusivity. In the OSR we aim to model an academic community we wish to be a part of, where we interact with each other with curiosity, kindness and respect.</p>

          <h3>How to get involved!</h3>

          <p>You can follow the content of the OSR by visiting our virtual space, following the <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/access/">live broadcast</a> online, or giving a <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/submit/">remote presentation</a>.</p>

          <p>We are also keen to hear from you if you would like to <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/contribute/">help us build the OSR</a>! We firmly believe that the more involved the community is in this project, the more ownership they will take over it and the more we will all benefit from our collective expertise in creating an exciting, inspiring and joyful experience!</p>

          <h3>How to get in touch!</h3>

          <p>We would be very pleased to hear from you to discuss any aspect of the OSR! Our communication channels are listed <a href="https://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/contact/">here</a>.</p>
