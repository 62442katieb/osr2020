The OSR is built by the community for the community. The OS-SIG have been working hard to make this the biggest and best OSR yet, and we would love for you to contribute to the success of this event by helping us to build it! This is an excellent opportunity to work as an integral part of a conference organising team, build relationships with key members of the open neuroimaging community before and during the meeting, and shape the conference experience of those around you!

You don't need to have specific experience in open science or even brain imaging to join us! All we ask is that you are interested in providing a professional, welcoming, inclusive and inspiring OSR experience for your colleagues. We will also ask you to join us in regular on-line meetings, to support your progress with any activity you have chosen to undertake.

Below is a general description of the types of work we'd love for the community to get involved with. If you'd like to share your skills in these or any other areas, please fill in the [form](#volunteer-to-build) below to get in touch. We will email you back as soon as we can to arrange a chat, and you are under no obligation to agree to any work at this stage!

## OSR Hosts

OSR Hosts will be onsite to welcome speakers and guests in the OSR. We would also love you to be involved in designing our opening and closing events, overseeing the physical use of the multipurpose OSR space, chair sessions, and ensure that we are reaching our goals for accessibility. The [OS-SIG and OSR Co-Chairs](https://ossig.netlify.com/) will help build and support your efforts all the way.

## Onsite and Online Tech Support

For the first time in OHBM and OSR history, we will be broadcasting all the scheduled OSR material live via the [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ) to anyone who would like to tune in! We have been greatly supported by OHBM and the conference venue in arranging the live broadcast, but there are a number of additional technical challenges we will encounter onsite as a result. We are also hoping to introduce live captioning of presentations for improved accessibility, and a number of physical and computational systems for impact monitoring. If you like fiddling with a bit of tech (hardware and software!) we'd love for you to join us in helping to deliver the professional and accessibly OSR experience our community deserves.

## Branding and Merchandise

We love a bit of merch. Branding and merchandise will create an identity for the OSR, and subsequently project an identity for our community. We are proud of the work we do, and we want to create devices which can unite us while bringing others in. This includes onsite signage, badges, t-shirts for our volunteers (if you'd like them!) and holding screens for the live broadcast and between talks. We're also not too precious about our colour schemes and current logo, so if you think that could be improved, you're welcome to have a play!
