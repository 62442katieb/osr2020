The OSR is built by the community for the community.
The OS-SIG has been working hard to make this the biggest and best OSR yet, and we would love for you to contribute to the success of this event by helping us to build it! This is an excellent opportunity to work as an integral part of a conference organising team, build relationships with key members of the open neuroimaging community before and during the meeting, and shape the conference experience of those around you!

You don't need to have specific experience in open science or even brain imaging to join us! All we ask is that you are interested in providing a professional, welcoming, inclusive and inspiring OSR experience for your colleagues. We will also ask you to join us in regular on-line meetings, to support your progress with any activity you have chosen to undertake.

We have identified some specific roles or work packages we would love for you to be involved in. If you'd like to share your skills in these or any other areas, please fill in the [form](#volunteer-to-build) below to get in touch. We will email you back as soon as we can to arrange a chat,
and you are under no obligation to agree to any work at this stage!

## OSR Hosts

<img align="right" src="../img/undraw_Hello_qnas.svg" alt="host" width="30%">

OSR Hosts will be onsite to welcome speakers and guests in the OSR. We would also love for you to be involved in designing our opening and closing events, overseeing the physical use of the multipurpose OSR space, chair sessions, and ensure that we are reaching our goals for accessibility.
The [OS-SIG and OSR Co-Chairs](https://ossig.netlify.com/) will help build and support your efforts all the way.

## Open Research Advisor

<img align="right" src="../img/undraw_code_review_l1q9.svg" alt="officehours" width="40%">

Stepping into the Open Science field can be a daunting task, and we want to help with that. Many of our community members have years of experience and loads of skills in open source programming, analysis methods, open publishing and peer review, data and code sharing tools and practices. On the other hand, many of us are new to all of this and would like to know more! We want to create an informal, inclusive and helpful environment where newcomers are encouraged to ask questions, and experienced open neuroimagers or open sciencers are happy to answer them. If you like helping others and would like to share your knowledge in the OSR, please let us know!

<div id='tech'></div>
## Onsite and Online Tech Support

<img align="right" src="../img/undraw_programmer_imem.svg" alt="tech" width="40%">

For the first time in OHBM and OSR history, we will be broadcasting all the scheduled OSR material live via the [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ)
to anyone who would like to tune in! We have been greatly supported by OHBM and the conference venue in arranging the live broadcast, but there are a number of additional technical challenges we will encounter onsite as a result. We are also hoping to introduce live captioning of presentations for improved accessibility, and a number of physical and computational systems for impact monitoring. If you like fiddling with a bit of tech (hardware and software!) we'd love for you to join us in helping to deliver the professional and accessible OSR experience our community deserves.

## Branding and Merchandise

<img align="right" src="../img/undraw_logo_design_bjnx.svg" alt="branding" width="40%">

We love a bit of merch. Branding and merchandise will create an identity for the OSR, and subsequently project an identity for our community. We are proud of the work we do, and we want to create devices which can unite us while bringing others in. This includes onsite signage, badges, t-shirts for our volunteers (if you'd like them!) and holding screens for the live broadcast and between talks. We're also not too precious about our colour schemes and current logo, so if you think that could be improved, you're welcome to have a play! If you have a creative mind and like designing and building, feel free to join!

## Social and Media

<img align="right" src="../img/undraw_tweetstorm_49e8.svg" alt="branding" width="40%">

Crafting material for social media and communications is an art form, particularly if this material is targeted at both public and discipline specific audiences. If you are an avid blogger, tweeter, or other media generator, we would love for you to help disseminate the experience of the OSR to our online audiences. This may include working with the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3910">OHBM Communications Committee</a> team during the meeting to record the experience, with the <a href="https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/">Blog</a> team to develop a post after the meeting, and some live communication during the meeting itself. This would be a great opportunity to practice your public engagement and communication skills, while being an essential root to bring people into the OSR and share the ethos of open research practice.
