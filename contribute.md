The OSR is built by the community for the community. The OS-SIG have been working in the background to make this the biggest and best OSR yet, and we would love for you to contribute to the success of this community event!

You are very welcome to join us at any point in the conference. But if you would like to be a little more hands on, you're very welcome to help build the OSR you would like to see! This is an excellent opportunity to experience working as an integral part of a conference organising team, and an excellent opportunity to shape the conference experience of those around you.

You don't need to have specific experience in open science, or even brain imaging! All we ask is that you are interested in providing a kind, welcoming, inclusive and inspiring experience for your colleagues, and you're able to join the OSR organising committee in fortnightly online meetings.

We love to have support from people onsite at the meeting itself (a great way to make friends if you're already coming to Montreal!), but there is also work to be done before the meeting which doesn't require travel.

Below is a general description of the types of work we'd love for the community to engage with us on. If you'd like to share your skills in building these activities, or like to be involved in any other way, please fill in the form below to get in touch. We're very happy to have a chat about what we'll be working on before you commit to anything, so please don't be shy!

## OSR Hosts

OSR Hosts will be onsite to welcome speakers and guests in the OSR. We would also love you to be involved in designing our opening and closing events, overseeing the physical use of the multipurpose OSR space, chair sessions, and ensure that we are reaching our goals for accessibility. The [OS-SIG and OSR Co Chairs](https://ossig.netlify.com/) will help build and support your efforts all the way.

## Onsite and Online Tech Support

For the first time in OHBM and OSR history, we will be broadcasting all the scheduled OSR material live via the [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ) to anyone who would like to tune in! We have been greatly supported by OHBM and the conference venue in arranging the live broadcast, but there a number of additional technical challenges we will encounter onsite as a result. We are also hoping to introduce live captioning of presentations for improved accessibility, and a number of physical and computational systems for impact monitoring. If you like fiddling with a bit of tech (hardware and software!) we'd love for you to join us in helping to deliver the professional and accessibly OSR experience our community deserves.

## Branding and Merchandise

We love a bit of merch. Branding and merchandise will create an identity for the OSR, and subsequently project an identity for our community. We are proud of the work we do, and we want to create devices which can unite us while bringing others in. This includes onsite signage, badges, t-shirts for our volunteers (if you'd like them!) and holding screens for the live broadcast and between talks. We're also not too precious about our colour schemes and current logo, so if you think that could be improved, you're welcome to have a play!.
