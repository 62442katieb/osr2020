## How to connect

Watch via [OS-SIG YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvSitFvqGDeA1y7MJs4CGQ)

<div id='questions'></div>
## How to ask questions

Youtube comments during the talks - may be a delay of a few minutes in the broadcast, so do not wait until the end to ask questions - ask as soon as you think of them!

And on twitter @OhbmOpen #OHBM #OSR #WatchParty - need to think of a way of identifying each talk.

<div id='schedule'></div>
## What is happening when
