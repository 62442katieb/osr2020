# Show us where you are watching!

We'd love to see where you are watching from! We'd also love to help your colleagues find you so you can watch the action in the OSR together, and share the experience!

Show your watch party on this map by adding it to this [open calendar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D1GeMmfc14zmYXt9059h5-op8n8x72mq&usp=sharing). Simply search for your location and click `Add to Map` then the pencil icon to `Edit` the details. Please provide the contact name for the person organising the watch party, and any additional details which might be useful for someone wanting to join you!

Three's a crowd, but four is a party! ðŸŽ‰
